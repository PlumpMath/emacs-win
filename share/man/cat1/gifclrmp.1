       A program to modify GIF image colormaps. Any local colormap in a GIF
       file can be modified at a time, or the global screen one.

       -v
           Verbose mode (show progress). Enables printout of running scan
           lines.

       -s
           Select the global screen color map.

       -l mapfile
           Load color map from this file instead of selected color map.

       -t trans
           Change color index values. The change is made to both the selected
           color table and the raster bits of the selected image. A
           translation file is a list of pairs of `before' and `after' index
           values. At present, the `before' index values must be in ascending
           order starting from 0.

       -g gamma
           Apply gamma correction to selected color map.

       -i image
           Select the color map of the numbered image.

       -h
           Print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

       If no GIF file is given, gifclip will try to read a GIF file from
       stdin.

NNOOTTEESS
       +o   The default operation is to dump out the selected color map in text
           format.

       +o   The file to load/dump is simply one color map entry per line. Each
           such entry line has four integers: "ColorIndex Red Green Blue",
           where color index is in ascending order starting from 1.
