       A program to save stdin into a file with given name, iff the result
       file has size bigger than specified (see below). This can be used to
       save a result under the same filename we started with in a chain of
       pipes.

       Always reads a GIF file from stdin.

       -v
           Verbose mode (show progress). Enables printout of running scan
           lines.

       -s MinFileSize
           If file is less than MinFileSize, it is deleted and not renamed to
           the given name. This will prevent killing the file we started with
           if the result is an empty file, or the pipeline did not complete.

           The default file threshold size is 14 bytes, which is 1 bigger than
           GIF file stamp (6 bytes) plus a GIF file screen descriptor (7
           bytes), so a GIF file with only GIF stamp and screen descriptor
           will not be renamed.

       -h
           Print one line of command line help, similar to Usage above.
