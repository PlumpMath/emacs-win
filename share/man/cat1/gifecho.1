       A program to generate GIF images out of regular text. Text can be one
       line or multi-line, and is converted using 8 by 8 fixed font.

       This program reads stdin if no text is provided on the command line
       (-t), and will dump the created GIF file to stdout.

       -v
           Verbose mode (show progress). Enables printout of running scan
           lines.

       -s colormap-size
           Explicitly defines the size of the color map of the resulting gif
           image. Usually the image will be bicolor with fg as color 1, unless
           [-f] is explicitly given in case the color map size will be big
           enough to hold it. However it is sometimes convenient to set the
           color map size to certain size while the fg color is small mainly
           so this image may be merged with another (images must match color
           map size).

       -f foreground
           Select foreground index (background is always 0). By default it is
           one and therefore the image result is bicolored. if FG is set to n
           then color map will be created with 2^k entries where 2^k > n for
           minimum k, assuming k <= 8. This color map will be all zeros except
           this forground index. This option is useful if this text image
           should be integrated into other image colormap using their colors.

       -c R G B
           The color to use as the foreground color. White by default.

       -t text
           One line of text can be provided on the command line. Note you must
           encapsulate the Text within quotes if it has spaces (The quotes
           themselves are not treated as part of the text). If no -t option is
           provided, stdin is read until end of file.

       -h
           Print one line command line help, similar to Usage above.

NNOOTTEESS
       There is a hardcoded limit of 100 the number of lines.
